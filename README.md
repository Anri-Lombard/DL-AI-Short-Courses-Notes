# My Learning Journey with DeepLearning.ai Short Courses

Welcome to my repository! Here, I document my ongoing learning journey through the [DeepLearning.ai Short Courses](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/).

## Effective Learning Approach

With 14.5 years of formal education and numerous online training experiences, I have developed a process to maximize the retention of knowledge. I have found the following steps particularly useful:

1. **Engage:** Watch the course videos attentively and jot down important notes.
2. **Experiment:** Explore the notebooks, understand the underlying logic, and experiment with code. This step is intentionally separate from the first one, as understanding is often mistaken for merely following instructions.
3. **Create:** (Optional) Attempt to build something from scratch using the learned concepts. This step, although challenging, consolidates understanding and encourages practical application.

## Repository Contents
