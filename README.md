# DeepLearning.ai Short Courses

This repository is an ongoing documentation of my notes and insights from taking the [DeepLearning.ai Short Courses](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/).

## How to learn these courses

I've had a lot of practice learning online and offline, given my 14.5 years of formal education along with much online training. This is the process I found useful to retain the most of what was taught:

1. Watch the videos and take notes.
2. Play around with the notebooks and try to understand what is happening through experimentation. It is important to separate this step from the previous one because it's easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand something when you're just following along.
3. (Optional) Build something with it yourself from scratch. This is more difficult and only useful when the other 2 steps were done.
